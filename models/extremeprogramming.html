            <td>
              &#10133; The main advantage of Extreme Programming is that this methodology allows software development companies to save costs and time required for project realization. Time savings are available because of the fact that XP focuses on the timely delivery of final products. Extreme Programming teams save lots of money because they donâ€™t use too much documentation. They usually solve problems through discussions inside of the team.

            <td>
              &#10134; Some specialists say that Extreme Programming is focused on the code rather than on design. That may be a problem because good design is extremely important for software applications. It helps sell them in the software market. Additionally, in XP projects the defect documentation is not always good. Lack of defect documentation may lead to the occurrence of similar bugs in the future.

            <td>
                &#10133; Simplicity is one more advantage of Extreme Programming projects. The developers who prefer to use this methodology create extremely simple code that can be improved at any moment.
            </td>
            <td>
                &#10134; One more disadvantage of XP is that this methodology does not measure code quality assurance. It may cause defects in the initial code.

            <td>
                &#10133; The whole process in XP is visible and accountable. Developers commit what they will accomplish and show progress.

                &#10134; XP is not the best option if programmers are separated geographically.
