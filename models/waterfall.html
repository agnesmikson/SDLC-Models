              &#10133;  When compared with other methodologies, Waterfall focuses most on a clear, defined set of steps. Its structure is simple.

            <td>
              &#10134;  The main purpose of the Waterfall Methodology is to help the internal team to move more proficiently through the project phases. As it is an internal process the focus on the involvement of end client in the project is very little. The clients often show their involvement concerns in the project to give an opinion and clarify their requirements.

        <tr>
            <td>
                &#10133; The output in the Waterfall model, after each phase, creates high visibility. By analyzing the output of each stage, it can be determined by the project manager and client that the project is making considerable progress.
            </td>
            <td>
                &#10134; The waterfall process does not perform step-wise testing, therefore, any issue can cause a lot of problems later. As there is no turning back, once a mistake has been made it can not be resolved in the next phase.
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>
                &#10133; As the Waterfall model has different phases, the output of each phase is analyzed before it is sent to the next phase. This standard data supervision can reduce the risk of problematic issues.
            </td>
            <td>
                &#10134; Integration is an end process which prevents the identification of any technological or business bottleneck. It may also challenge the process at the early stages.
